Arrays and Strings in C++

## Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to understand and implement the basic concepts of arrays and strings in C++. We will explore various operations on arrays like creating, displaying, reversing, searching, and finding the sum, average, maximum, and minimum elements. Additionally, we will perform string manipulations such as concatenation, reversing, and checking for palindromes.

## Software Used:
- Dev c++

## Theory:
<h5>Arrays:</h5>
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in an array can be accessed using an index. Arrays are used when multiple elements need to be stored and accessed using a single variable name. They are particularly useful in scenarios where we need to perform operations on multiple elements together, like sorting, searching, and calculating the sum or average.

<h5>Strings:</h5>
A string is a sequence of characters treated as a single data type. In C++, strings are represented as arrays of characters, but the language provides the string class in the standard library, which offers a range of functionalities to manipulate strings efficiently. Strings are widely used for handling text data, and common operations include concatenation, reversing, and checking for palindromes.
